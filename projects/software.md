# Software

Tools and code that support our research and collaborators.

## What we do

- Build and maintain research codebases (PyTorch/JAX) for our projects.
- Share reproducible pipelines and datasets where possible.
- Document patterns and utilities the rest of the lab can reuse.

We’ll add links and repositories here as they go public.
