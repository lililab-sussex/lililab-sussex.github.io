# Collaborating with Us

Some information more targeted at potential collaborators.

## How we collaborate

- Co-develop research questions that align with interpretable ML for inverse problems.
- Set clear expectations on data access, timelines, and publication goals.
- Share code and documentation early to keep joint work reproducible.

If you’re interested in partnering, reach out with your problem statement, data modality, and what success looks like for you. We’ll follow up with next steps and potential project scopes.
