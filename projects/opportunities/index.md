# Opportunities

Reach out to us if you are interested in working with/in our lab! Some opportunities include:

- [Working in our lab](./working-in-our-lab): expectations, skills, and resources for joining as a PhD or Masters student.
- [Collaborating with us](./collaborating-with-us): how we scope projects with partners and keep work reproducible.

We’ll keep adding specifics on open roles, visiting options, and ways to partner.
