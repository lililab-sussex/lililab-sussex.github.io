# LILI Lab
We are the Learners of Interpretable Latent Information (LILI) Lab, based in the Department of Informatics, University of Sussex.
We create interpretable ML models for ”inverse problems”, where the information of interest is not directly measurable. 

We aim to build models that are:
- Useful, providing meaningful insights to our interdisciplinary collaborators.
- Aware of uncertainty and communicate this.
- Contributing trustworthy tools for healthcare applications
