The LILI Lab develops interpretable machine learning and statistical methods for inverse problems, where key information cannot be measured directly. Our work focuses on spatiotemporal data in medical imaging, disease progression modelling, computer vision, and ecological monitoring.

Explore our four main research themes:

- [Medical Image Analysis](./medical-image-analysis): Work on MRI reconstruction, image registration, and related inverse problems.
- [Computer Vision](./computer-vision): Projects spanning visual recognition, reconstruction, and interpretable models for vision tasks.
- [Ecological Monitoring](./ecological-monitoring): Interpretable learning for ecological data, from species monitoring to environmental sensing.
- [Machine Learning](./machine-learning): Core methodological work on probabilistic modeling, interpretability, and efficient training for inverse problems.
