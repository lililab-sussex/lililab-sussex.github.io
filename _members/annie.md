I am investigating how cognition and underlying biological factors progresses from healthy aging progresses to Alzheimer's disease by modeling multimodal data. My current interests lies in how speech, cognitive batteries, neuroimaging, and blood-based biomarkers can be integrated to reveal patterns of Alzheimer’s disease progression and identify early signs of cognitive impairment.
