DNNs are powerful but opaque, limiting trust.  I study learning as a self‑organising dynamical process, using tools from physics to probe training and representation formation. My work spans: (1) what gradient descent learns preferentially (2) new algorithms exploiting alternative hardware and symbolic/structured inference.   Keywords: optimisation theory, AI safety, bio-inspired algorithms.
